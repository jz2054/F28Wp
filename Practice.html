        <h1>My First Webpage</h1>

        <p>This are the tags used to reperesent/identify or structure a paragraph in HTML.Note that this is the first
        paragraph that is going to appear on my webpage when run on the browser.Below I am going going to put another paragraph
         inside the <em>div</em> tags and explain why.</p>

        <div id = "first div">
            <p>We have added the <em>div</em> tags outside the <em>p</em> tags in case we later want to to perform 
        certain operations only to this paragraph or a set of paragraphs within this <strong>div</strong> tags</p> 
        <P>Here is our second paragraph within the div. We can have more than one tag of the same type and to differentiate
        it from any other in case of an operation we can assign a value inside of the openig tag and use that as a reference
        . We shall see this when we style or interact with our page usin CSS and javascript respectively.</P>
        </div>

        <div>
